# Contributing to Flutter Examples

## Welcome

The aim is to provide working examples of how Flutter integrates with other technologies.

## Guidelines

1. Each example of Flutter application must be contained in its own folder under this repository and must be a standalone runable instance.
2. The folder and project naming convention is as follows
   ```
   with_example_name
   ```
3. A README.md file is appreciated for detailed explanation and/or guide on running the applicaiton.
4. It is expected that codes are clearly written for comprehension. One rule of thumb is to write with beginners in mind.
